# "Codebase Cleanup" Exercise

> Prerequisites:
>  + [Software Maintenance and Quality Control](/units/unit-8.md)
>  + ["Testing, 1,2,3" Exercise](/exercises/testing-123/README.md)
>  + ["CI, 1,2,3" Exercise](/exercises/ci-123/README.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Practice simplifying and refactoring code to improve readability and quality and decrease maintenance costs.
  + Practice writing and executing automated tests to verify your program behaves as expected.
  + Practice GitHub Pull Request workflow, including Git Branch operations and code review capabilities
  + Practice running automated tests on a Continuous Integration server, and incorporating CI checks into your development workflow.

## Instructions

### Practice Round

Fork the Professor's [Codebase Cleanup Starter Repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/codebase-cleanup-starter-py), and follow its README instructions to setup a new virtual environment, install package dependencies, and run the tests.

Follow along during class as the professor iteratively simplifies and tests the code in the starter repo. Think of ways to relate the starter code to other code you may have written recently.

### Your Turn

Revisit your previous projects and tackle their respective "testing challenges":

  + [Shopping Cart Project - Testing Challenges](/projects/shopping-cart/testing.md)
  + [Robo Advisor Project - Testing Challenges](/projects/robo-advisor/testing.md)

Use Git Branch Operations and Pull Request Workflow as you develop.

> BONUS: also incorporate Continuous Integration into your workflow.

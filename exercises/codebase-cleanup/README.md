>  + [Software Maintenance and Quality Control](/units/unit-8.md)
>  + ["Testing, 1,2,3" Exercise](/exercises/testing-123/README.md)
>  + ["CI, 1,2,3" Exercise](/exercises/ci-123/README.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Practice simplifying and refactoring code to improve readability and quality and decrease maintenance costs.
  + Practice writing and executing automated tests to verify your program behaves as expected, and incorporating automated testing into your development workflow.
  + Practice incorporating GitHub Pull Requests into your development workflow.
  + Practice running automated tests on a Continuous Integration server, and incorporating CI checks into your development workflow.

## Instructions

Revisit your previous projects and tackle their respective "testing challenges":

  + [Shopping Cart Project - Testing Challenges](/projects/shopping-cart/testing.md)
  + [Robo Advisor Project - Testing Challenges](/projects/robo-advisor/testing.md)

Start developing on a new branch called something like "cleanup" or "qc", and incorporate GitHub Pull Requests into your development workflow.

Optionally also configure your application's tests to run on a platform like Travis CI, and incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) into your workflow (BONUS).

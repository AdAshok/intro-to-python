# "Run the App" Exercise

> Prerequisites:
>   + [Development Environment Setup](/units/unit-0.md), including creation of a GitHub Account and installation of Anaconda, VS Code, and GitHub Desktop software
>   + [Information Systems and Software](/units/unit-1.md)
>   + ["Command-line Computing" Exercise](/exercises/command-line-computing) - recommended, as it will help you learn how to navigate your filesystem via the command-line

## Learning Objectives

Before we start writing our own Python applications, let's learn how to run existing applications. This will help us become familiar with various dev tools and command-line utilities we'll be working with throughout the semester.

## Instructions

Visit the source code repository for the Professor's [My First Python App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/my-first-python-app) and click "Fork" to copy the repo under your own control. Then download (or "clone") your copy of the repo onto your local machine using GitHub Desktop.

Then use your command line application (Terminal on Mac, or Git Bash on Windows) to navigate to the location where you downloaded this repo. Open the repo with your text editor (VS Code), and inspect the contents of the its "README.md" file. Follow the instructions in the "README.md" file as guided by the professor.

Your goal is to demonstrate your ability to run this app locally via the command-line.

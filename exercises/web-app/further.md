# "Web App" Exercise - Further Exploration

## Integrating with a Google Sheets Datastore

Fork this [Starter Web Application w/ Google Sheets Datastore repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/web-app-starter-flask-sheets) under your own control and then clone / download it onto your local computer.

Follow the setup instructions to configure your own Google Sheet.

Follow the installation and usage instructions to demonstrate your ability to run the app locally in your browser at http://localhost:5000/.

Follow the deployment instructions to push your app to a Heroku server, then demonstrate your ability to visit the app via its public URL!

## Configuring a Web App for Deployment

So far both of the repositories referenced above already contain configuration files which allow them to be hosted on a Heroku server. This [Rock-Paper-Scissors Web App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/rock-paper-scissors-flask) runs locally, but has not yet been deployed to a public-facing Heroku server.

Fork the repo under your own control and then clone / download it onto your local computer. Follow the installation and usage instructions to demonstrate your ability to run the app locally in your browser at http://localhost:5000/.

See if you can push your app to a Heroku server, then demonstrate your ability to visit the app via its public URL!

## Creating your own Web App

Alright, so you can deploy existing web applications, but can you create your own from scratch? Follow [the Flask package](/notes/python/packages/flask.md) documentation and leverage the professor's example applications as desired to create your own web app, and demonstrate your ability to run it locally.

Then deploy your app to a production Heroku server and demonstrate your ability to visit the app via its public URL!

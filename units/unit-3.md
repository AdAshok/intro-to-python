# Unit 3: Processing and Validating User Inputs

> Prerequisites: [Python Language Overview](unit-2.md)

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we'll learn how process and validate user inputs in Python as we create tools to facilitate business operations. We'll also begin to leverage built-in Python modules to extend the capabilities of our Python programs.

## Discussions and Notes

  + User Interfaces (UI) and User Experience (UX)
  + Capturing and Validating User Inputs:
    + [The `input()` Function](/notes/python/inputs.md)
  + Native Graphical User Interfaces:
    + [The `PySimpleGUI` Package](/notes/python/packages/pysimplegui.md)
    + [The `tkinter` Package](/notes/python/packages/tkinter.md)

Optional Further Exploration:

  + Messaging Interfaces:
    + [The `sendgrid` Package](/notes/python/packages/sendgrid.md) (for sending emails)
    + [The `twilio` Package](/notes/python/packages/twilio.md) (for sending SMS)
    + [The `tweepy` Package](/notes/python/packages/tweepy.md) (for sending tweets :bird:)
  + Voice Interfaces:
    + [The `speech_recognition` Package](/notes/python/packages/speech_recognition.md)
  + Web Application Interfaces:
    + [The `flask` Package](/notes/python/packages/flask.md) (advanced topic)

## Activities and Exercises

  + ["Rock, Paper, Scissors" Exercise](/exercises/rock-paper-scissors/README.md)
  + ["Shopping Cart" Project](/projects/shopping-cart/README.md)

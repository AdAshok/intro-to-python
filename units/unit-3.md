# Unit 2: Processing and Validating User Inputs

> Prerequisites: [Python Language Overview](unit-2.md)

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we'll learn how process and validate user inputs in Python as we create tools to facilitate business operations. We'll also begin to leverage built-in Python modules to extend the capabilities of our Python programs.

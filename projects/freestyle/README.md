# The "Freestyle" Project

> Prerequisites:
>   + [Software Products and Services](/units/unit-10.md)
>   + [The Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](/units/unit-10.md)

The Self-Directed (a.k.a. "Freestyle") Project provides students with the flexibility and support to create basic application software to suit their own business or personal interests.

## Learning Objectives

  + Propose and implement a software solution to address some real-life problem and the needs of real users.
  + Participate in the entire Systems Development Lifecycle, including system planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance.
  + Follow personal interests and passions, and find an outlet for creative expression.
  + Optional: Practice collaborating on a software project with other individuals.

## Scope and Subject Matter

The project's scope should be roughly equivalent or greater than previous "guided" projects (i.e. Shopping Cart, Robo Advisor). Students can choose whatever subject matter is interesting for them, but should prefer to achieve a unique set of functionality.

## Phases

First students will brainstorm and submit a proposal outlining their project's scope, objectives, and requirements. Then students will implement the requirements by writing their own Python applications.

  1. Proposal Phase (Learning and Planning)
  2. Implementation Phase (Building and Testing)

# The Self-Directed (a.k.a "Freestyle") Project

> Prerequisites:
>   + [Software Maintenance and Quality Control](/units/unit-8.md)
>   + [Software Products and Services](/units/unit-9.md)
>   + [The Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](/units/unit-10.md)

This project provides students with an opportunity to create software to suit their own business or personal interests.

## Learning Objectives

  + Propose and implement a software solution to address some real-life problem and the needs of real users.
  + Participate in the entire Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC), including planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance.
  + Follow personal interests and passions, and find an outlet for creative expression.
  + Practice building software within a larger team (optional).

## Scope and Complexity

The project's scope should be roughly equivalent to the previous "guided" projects (i.e. Shopping Cart, Robo Advisor), or greater if desired.

## Subject Matter

Students can choose whatever subject matter is interesting for them, but should prefer to find solutions which are both practical.

achieve a unique set of functionality.

## Groups

Students have the option of working by themselves, or in groups of the designated size (usually two or maybe three total members).

To fairly evaluate groups of different sizes, projects may be ranked against others of the same group composition (e.g. solo projects vs other solo projects, two-person teams vs other two-person teams, etc.).

To incentivize individual effort within groups, each group member may be asked to submit a form describing and rating the roles and relative contributions of all other group members.

## Deliverables

First students will brainstorm and submit a proposal outlining their project's scope, objectives, and requirements. Then students will implement the requirements by writing their own Python applications.
